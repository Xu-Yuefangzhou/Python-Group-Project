    Creates a new ``Microphone`` instance, which represents a physical microphone on the computer. Subclass of ``AudioSource``.

    This will throw an ``AttributeError`` if you don't have PyAudio 0.2.11 or later installed.

    If ``device_index`` is unspecified or ``None``, the default microphone is used as the audio source. Otherwise, ``device_index`` should be the index of the device to use for audio input.

    A device index is an integer between 0 and ``pyaudio.get_device_count() - 1`` (assume we have used ``import pyaudio`` beforehand) inclusive. It represents an audio device such as a microphone or speaker. See the `PyAudio documentation <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/>`__ for more details.

    The microphone audio is recorded in chunks of ``chunk_size`` samples, at a rate of ``sample_rate`` samples per second (Hertz). If not specified, the value of ``sample_rate`` is determined automatically from the system's microphone settings.

    Higher ``sample_rate`` values result in better audio quality, but also more bandwidth (and therefore, slower recognition). Additionally, some CPUs, such as those in older Raspberry Pi models, can't keep up if this value is too high.

    Higher ``chunk_size`` values help avoid triggering on rapidly changing ambient noise, but also makes detection less sensitive. This value, generally, should be left at its default.

        Spawns a thread to repeatedly record phrases from ``source`` (an ``AudioSource`` instance) into an ``AudioData`` instance and call ``callback`` with that ``AudioData`` instance as soon as each phrase are detected.

        Returns a function object that, when called, requests that the background listener thread stop. The background thread is a daemon and will not stop the program from exiting if there are no other non-daemon threads. The function accepts one parameter, ``wait_for_stop``: if truthy, the function will wait for the background listener to stop before returning, otherwise it will return immediately and the background listener thread might still be running for a second or two afterwards. Additionally, if you are using a truthy value for ``wait_for_stop``, you must call the function from the same thread you originally called ``listen_in_background`` from.

        Phrase recognition uses the exact same mechanism as ``recognizer_instance.listen(source)``. The ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter works in the same way as the ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter for ``recognizer_instance.listen(source)``, as well.

        The ``callback`` parameter is a function that should accept two parameters - the ``recognizer_instance``, and an ``AudioData`` instance representing the captured audio. Note that ``callback`` function will be called from a non-main thread.

        Performs speech recognition on ``audio_data`` (an ``AudioData`` instance), using the Microsoft Bing Speech API.

        The Microsoft Bing Speech API key is specified by ``key``. Unfortunately, these are not available without `signing up for an account <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-api/>`__ with Microsoft Azure.

        To get the API key, go to the `Microsoft Azure Portal Resources <https://portal.azure.com/>`__ page, go to "All Resources" > "Add" > "See All" > Search "Bing Speech API > "Create", and fill in the form to make a "Bing Speech API" resource. On the resulting page (which is also accessible from the "All Resources" page in the Azure Portal), go to the "Show Access Keys" page, which will have two API keys, either of which can be used for the `key` parameter. Microsoft Bing Speech API keys are 32-character lowercase hexadecimal strings.

        The recognition language is determined by ``language``, a BCP-47 language tag like ``"en-US"`` (US English) or ``"fr-FR"`` (International French), defaulting to US English. A list of supported language values can be found in the `API documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/api-reference-rest/bingvoicerecognition#recognition-language>`__ under "Interactive and dictation mode".

        Returns the most likely transcription if ``show_all`` is false (the default). Otherwise, returns the `raw API response <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/api-reference-rest/bingvoicerecognition#sample-responses>`__ as a JSON dictionary.

        Raises a ``speech_recognition.UnknownValueError`` exception if the speech is unintelligible. Raises a ``speech_recognition.RequestError`` exception if the speech recognition operation failed, if the key isn't valid, or if there is no internet connection.
